# Sales-Data-Analysis-With-Python

A short analysis about sales online. Thanks to "https://github.com/EDSOfficial".

Q1. What is the overall sales trend? 
Q2. Which are the Top 10 products by sales?
Q3. Which are the Most Selling Products?
Q4. Which is the most preferred Ship Mode?
Q5. Which are the Most Profitable Category and Sub-Category?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib and seaborn library methods. They include:
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
